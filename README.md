# Soil_spectroscopy
We use Vis, Vis-NIR, and MIR data from soil samples to estimate soil nutrients through PLS and ANN models. This respository allows you to replicate the procedure, add your own soil data to predict its nutrients, and improve the models. 

I wrote this analysis for a paper a year ago when my programming skills were not as it are today. If you need to use this script, you may prefer to change it for a tydiverse writting style.

Either way, the script is fully reproduciable as it is, and I would be more than happy to help you of something is not clear.
